Description: A system for identifying diseases or events from healthcare databases and
    preparing data for epidemiological studies. It includes capabilities not
    supported by 'SQL', such as matching strings by 'stringr' style regular
    expressions, and can compute comorbidity scores (Quan et al. (2005)
    <doi:10.1097/01.mlr.0000182534.19832.83>) directly on a database server. The
    implementation is based on 'dbplyr' with full 'tidyverse' compatibility.
