Description: A system for identifying diseases or events from healthcare database and
    preparing data for epidemiological studies. It features abilities that are
    not supported by SQL database, such as matching strings by 'stringr' style
    regular expression. The implementation is based on 'dbplyr' providing full
    compatibility with 'tidyverse'.
