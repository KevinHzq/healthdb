# healthdb: Working with Healthcare Databases

A system for identifying diseases or events from healthcare databases
and preparing data for epidemiological studies. It includes capabilities
not supported by 'SQL', such as matching strings by 'stringr' style
regular expressions, and can compute comorbidity scores (Quan et al.
(2005)
[doi:10.1097/01.mlr.0000182534.19832.83](https://doi.org/10.1097/01.mlr.0000182534.19832.83)
) directly on a database server. The implementation is based on 'dbplyr'
with full 'tidyverse' compatibility.
