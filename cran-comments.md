-   This is a re-submission addressing several issues identified, including one related to license. In the original LICENSE-file, "odcfun authors" was shown."odcfun" was the old name of this package and unintentionally left unchanged after I renamed the package to its current name. Therefore, "odcfun authors" meant myself, and I changed to "healthdb authors" in this submission.
